## Description
I created Tech Blog as a place for developers to discuss topics and technologies they have been learning. This project gives learners the opportunity to think deeply about new concepts. As they say, the best way to learn is to teach.

## Installation
You can use my application by visiting this [Heroku link](https://warm-earth-45899.herokuapp.com/).

## Usage
Instructions for use vary depending on the user's intentions. If the user would like to browse all posts and comments, they can simply scroll up and down the homepage and click on topics that interest them to view the body and comments of a given post. If the user would like to post and comment, they start by selecting "signup" in the header and providing a username and password. Once the user signs up, they are taken to their dashboard where they can view their posts and create new posts. If the user clicks create post, they are taken to a page where they can provide a title and body for a post that will save upon pressing "Create". From the dashboard, the user can also select posts to edit or delete. Once the user is signed in, they can visit the dashboard and leave comments on other user's posts.
